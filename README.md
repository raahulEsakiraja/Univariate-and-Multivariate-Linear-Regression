# Univariate-and-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

This project explores the differences between univariate and multivariate linear regression models in the context of predictive performance and interpretability. In a univariate regression, a single independent variable is used to predict a dependent variable, offering simplicity and clear insight into the relationship. However, it may overlook important contributing factors. In contrast, multivariate regression incorporates multiple independent variables, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the predictors' combined effects on the outcome.

Through side-by-side analysis, we evaluate how the inclusion of additional variables affects model accuracy, residual behavior, and potential multicollinearity. The study demonstrates that while univariate models are useful for baseline interpretation, multivariate models often yield improved performance when relevant predictors are availableâ€”provided assumptions such as linearity, independence, and lack of multicollinearity are addressed. This comparison highlights the trade-off between model complexity and clarity, guiding the selection of appropriate regression techniques based on data and analytical goals.
